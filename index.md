> My definition of sustainability

## About Us
As far back as I can remember I wanted to be a fashion designer; having my own atelier creating beautiful garments. In 2005 I first started learning about global warming and have since been more aware of the issue that we face. So when I became more serious in starting a brand I knew it had to be both sustainable and ethical.

## Philoshophy
Atelier Leyla’s mission is to create timeless garments that are both ethically and sustainably made using recycled and organic fabrics. Our aesthetic ranges from casual chic to business casual with neutrals and some bold colours. We use organic and recycled linens, twills, cottons, and wools for more of an effortless look that still put together.

The name Rüya means dream in Turkish and this is my dream to create a brand that won’t be detrimental to the environment.
